## Brand & Style

A2Flow's interface is engineered for AI-driven workflow automation. The visual language pairs **frosted-glass surfaces** with a single **aurora ribbon** — one band of light flowing diagonally across the canvas — evoking **Depth, Clarity, and Forward Motion**.

The personality is futuristic-yet-trustworthy: glassmorphism gives the UI a sense of layered transparency without sacrificing legibility, and the palette is deliberately concentrated. One accent (aurora mint) carries every interactive signal; the violet in the aurora's body exists only as light for the glass to refract, never as a competing UI accent. All brand hues are defined in `oklch()` rather than framework presets. Space Grotesk headings and JetBrains Mono data text keep the experience grounded for power users, and the signature **live edge** — accent light circling a panel's border while an agent works — makes "the system is flowing" visible.

The system supports **light** and **dark** themes via a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`, with all tokens cascading via CSS variables. The user's preference is persisted in `localStorage` (`a2flow.theme`) and falls back to `prefers-color-scheme`.

## Colors

The palette is a **single-accent system** defined in `oklch()`: one saturated **accent** (deep aquamarine in light, luminous aurora mint in dark) for every action and highlight, a supporting **aurora violet** confined to gradients and the background canvas, and a **glass** family (translucent whites in light, translucent slates in dark) for surfaces. Concentrating the visible hues into one mint-to-violet family is what gives the UI its impact — status colors aside, nothing else on screen competes with the accent.

- **Accent (`--color-accent`)** — Used for primary buttons, links, focus rings, active states, the streaming caret, and the live edge. Pairs with the secondary aurora violet for gradient fills (`from-accent to-secondary`); the violet never appears alone as a UI accent.
- **Glass surfaces** — Tiers: `glass`, `glass-strong`, `glass-overlay` (more translucent fill for floating popovers), plus `glass-highlight` for inner edges. Always rendered with a `backdrop-filter` blur + saturate (applied via Tailwind's `backdrop-blur`/`backdrop-saturate` utilities — see [Elevation & Depth](#elevation--depth)).
- **Aurora ribbon** — A single diagonal band of light painted on `body::before` (`bg-aurora-1` mint head, `bg-aurora-2` violet body, `bg-aurora-3` soft-cyan tail) provides the colored "light" that the glass refracts. Aurora colors differ between light and dark to match each theme's mood.
- **Semantic** — `error`, `success`, `alert` retained for status indication. `error-container` is rendered as translucent red.
- **Tag palette** — The one categorical palette in the system, for user-created [tags](https://kaitoy.github.io/a2flow/docs/guides/tags): eight slots (`mint`, `teal`, `cyan`, `indigo`, `violet`, `rose`, `amber`, `slate`) defined as `--c-tag-*` in `globals.css`, one value per slot per theme. They deliberately span more of the hue circle than the rest of the UI — the whole point of a tag color is to be told apart at a glance in a list — but each stays at roughly the accent's chroma and is rendered as a **tint**, never a fill: `.tag-chip` mixes 14% of the slot into the chip's background and 32% into its border, and takes the slot itself only for the text. A row of tags therefore reads as quiet metadata rather than competing with the single accent the UI is built around. The backend stores the *slot name*, never a color value, which is what lets light and dark carry different values (a chip sits on glass and needs contrast in both) and lets the palette be retuned later without rewriting rows. `frontend/src/lib/tag-palette.ts` maps a slot to its class; `.tag-swatch` draws the same slot as a solid dot — used both as the marker beside a `CheckboxGroup` option and as the pressable target in the tag picker dialog's color filter, where an unpressed swatch simply drops to `opacity-45` rather than changing hue. A third class, `.tag-chip-selected`, is the pressed state of a toggle chip: the same slot at roughly double the tint with a near-full-strength border and an inset hairline, so the vocabulary grid can show what is chosen without borrowing the focus ring's outline.
- **Avatar palette** — Generated user avatars ([boring-avatars](https://github.com/boringdesigners/boring-avatars), `beam` variant) draw from a five-color palette defined in `frontend/src/lib/avatar-palette.ts`: `#16BFA9` (mint accent), `#0E8A7C` (deep teal), `#7F62D5` (aurora violet), `#A7E8DC` (pale mint), `#CBD5E1` (slate neutral). It stays inside the mint-to-violet family so avatars read as part of the single-accent system rather than as a competing multi-hue palette. These are literal hex values, not `--c-*` custom properties, because the renderer takes the palette through a JS prop and parses each entry as hex; for the same reason one palette serves both themes instead of switching on `data-theme`. A user may override the palette from `/profile`.

## Typography

Three typefaces, three jobs — the pairing itself is part of the identity:

- **Space Grotesk** (`--font-display`, the `font-display` utility) is the display face for **all h1/h2 headings** and the "A2Flow" wordmark, giving titles a geometric, technical character. h1 grows to 30px so the scale contrast between a page title and its body is unmistakable.
- **Inter** remains the body face for text, labels, and small headings (h3 and below).
- **JetBrains Mono** (`--font-jetbrains-mono`, resolved by Tailwind's `font-mono` utility) is the data face — logs (`mono-log`), timestamps, session/tool IDs, and tag chips. Agent activity is A2Flow's raw material, and rendering it in a designed monospace instead of the generic system stack makes that material part of the brand.

Headings keep **tight letter-spacing** (`tracking-tight`) to lean into the futuristic feel. Label-caps use `0.08em` tracking and 11px size for a sharper, more compressed look. The `badge` scale (11px / 700 / 12px line-height, JetBrains Mono) is implemented as the `text-badge` utility — used for small numeric and fixed-label badges (`NotificationBell`'s unread count, `ToolActivityBubble`'s "MCP" tag). Badges are counts and constant labels — machine data — so they render in the mono data face, but keep their own scale without label-caps' forced uppercase/tracking/color, since badge color and case vary by call site. The `Tags` column's tag chips are a separate case: they take `Chip`'s compact `xs` size — the same 11px mono, but at normal weight and natural case, so two of them stack within one table row (see Shapes).

## Layout & Spacing

The app keeps the **Fixed Sidebar + Fluid Content** model. Sidebars are 256px wide and rendered as glass panels. Main content panels are centered with a max-width (`max-w-3xl` for chat, `max-w-6xl` for admin lists, `max-w-2xl` for forms) so glass panels feel like floating cards over the gradient canvas. The one form that grows past `max-w-2xl` is an admin detail page's form once it has earned a second column — see below.

The 8px base spacing unit is preserved. Padding inside glass cards is 24px (`p-6`).

### Admin form pages

Admin create pages nest a `FormColumn` (`max-w-2xl`, centered) inside `AdminPageContainer`, so the form reads as a narrow floating card while the breadcrumb and title above it stay flush left at the page's full width.

Admin **detail** pages nest a `FormLayout` instead. It stacks exactly like `FormColumn` while cramped, then splits into a fluid main column plus a fixed **16rem** trailing column once it has `@4xl` (56rem) of room. The trailing column carries read-only record metadata (`AuditMeta`) that would otherwise push the form's actions off screen. Its 16rem matches the `sidebar-width` token, and the 24px gutter is the standard `gutter`.

The page header goes *inside* `FormLayout`'s main column rather than above it. Its right-hand action cluster then lines up with the form's right edge instead of the page's, so a page-level action (an agent skill's "Generate Workflow", say) reads as belonging to the form rather than to the metadata column.

A detail page names **the record, not the operation**: its `AdminPageHeader` title and the last crumb of its `Breadcrumbs` trail both carry the record's own name (a workflow's name, a user's username, a task template's title), never a verb like "Edit". The name is user-provided and unbounded, so the heading truncates rather than pushing the action cluster off the page, and the crumb truncates the same way. Until the record loads, the title renders a `Skeleton` bar and the crumb an ellipsis, so neither the heading's height nor the trail's shape shifts when the name lands.

### Responsive & touch

- **Container queries** — the admin shell reserves a 256px sidebar, so viewport width overstates how much room a page actually has. Anything that reflows because *the content area* got wider (`FormLayout`'s second column, `DetailList`'s second column) uses `@container` + an `@`-prefixed variant rather than a viewport breakpoint, and the component renders its own `@container` wrapper so it behaves correctly wherever it is dropped. Viewport breakpoints stay for shell-level and device-level decisions.
- **Breakpoint** — `md` (768px) is the shell breakpoint: below it every fixed sidebar hides (`max-md:hidden`) and is reachable instead through a hamburger button in the `AppHeader` that opens the same sidebar component inside the shared `SidebarDrawer` (an off-canvas panel over a dimmed scrim, dismissed by scrim tap or Escape, with the modal focus wiring from `useDialogA11y`). Never build a page-specific drawer — pass the sidebar into `SidebarDrawer`.
- **Viewport height** — full-screen shells use `h-dvh`/`min-h-dvh`, never `h-screen` (100vh), so mobile URL bars don't clip the bottom of the layout. The chat input pads its bottom with `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.
- **Touch (`pointer-coarse:`)** — hover-revealed controls must also be reachable on touch: make them always visible under `pointer-coarse:` (see the session delete button). Icon buttons grow to ~44px hit targets under `pointer-coarse:`. Form fields render at 16px below `sm` so iOS Safari doesn't auto-zoom on focus. In the chat input, Enter inserts a newline on coarse pointers (sending is the Send button's job there).
- **Popovers** — fixed pixel widths are clamped to the viewport (`Math.min(PANEL_WIDTH, innerWidth - padding)`), see `NotificationPanel` / `UserMenu` / `TableHeaderMenu` / `Select`. The **vertical** half of that fit is what the shared `useAnchoredPanel` hook (`hooks/useAnchoredPanel.ts`) exists for: it measures the trigger, opens the panel below it while that side has room and flips it above when it does not, and reports the `maxHeight` the chosen side allows so a long panel scrolls inside the viewport instead of hanging off its bottom edge. `ColumnPicker` and `Select` are placed by it; new anchored panels should use it rather than hand-writing a fifth copy of the same `getBoundingClientRect` math.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is achieved through **layered translucency** rather than hard borders or heavy shadows.

- **Layer 0 (Canvas)** — `body::before` paints the fixed **aurora ribbon**: a single band of radial gradients flowing diagonally from the upper-left (mint head) through the center (violet body) to the lower-right (soft-cyan tail), with a faint counter-glow in the opposite corner for balance. It drifts very slowly along its own flow direction via the `aurora-drift` keyframes — ambient weather, not an animation. `body::after` overlays a subtle SVG film-grain to break up banding.
- **Layer 1 (Glass)** — `.glass-panel`: 55–65% translucent fill, 20px blur + 150% saturate, 1px white-tinted border, soft drop shadow + inner-top highlight.
- **Layer 2 (Glass-Strong)** — `.glass-panel-strong`: 72% translucent fill, 24px blur, larger drop shadow. Used for floating chat input and admin form cards.
- **Layer 2b (Glass-Overlay)** — `.glass-panel-overlay`: large shadow like glass-strong but a more translucent fill (light 45%, dark 38%) and a much lighter 8px blur, so whatever the popover covers stays readable rather than dissolving into a frosted wash. The full 160% saturate is kept — it carries the glass character the softened blur gives up, without obscuring what is underneath. Used for tooltips, dropdown/list menus (user menu, notification panel), and modal dialogs (`ConfirmDialog`, `RegistrySearchDialog`).
- **Chrome (Glass-Chrome)** — `.glass-chrome`: the edge-to-edge frame surfaces (app header, sidebars, timeline rail): the `glass` fill with a 24px blur + 150% saturate but no border or shadow of its own — each call site draws only the single edge border (`border-b`/`border-r border-glass-border`) its layout needs.
- **Glow** — Active/hover states emit a 36px accent glow (`shadow-glow`).

> **Note** — The `backdrop-filter` blur on all glass tiers is applied through Tailwind's `backdrop-blur-*`/`backdrop-saturate-*` utilities via `@apply`, not a raw `backdrop-filter` declaration: Tailwind v4 composes `backdrop-filter` from `--tw-backdrop-*` custom properties and silently drops a bare declaration written inside an `@utility`.

## Shapes

The shape language is **Soft Modern**.

- **Glass panels & cards:** `1rem` (16px) radius (`rounded-2xl`).
- **Buttons & inputs:** `0.75rem` (12px) radius (`rounded-xl`).
- **Status badges & short constant labels:** `rounded-full` for pill shapes (`Badge`). Their text is a fixed vocabulary — `stdio`, `Super Admin`, `MCP` — so it always fits on one line and the pill never breaks.
- **Data chips carrying variable-length text** (a dependency task's title, a `server: tool` binding — `Chip`): `rounded-md`, a `max-w-64` cap, and one-line clipping with the full text in a hover tooltip. The cap is sized to clear a 30-character mono label — the title budget the design agent is held to — so a well-formed title fits whole and only a runaway one clips. A pill radius is *half the box height*, so the moment an arbitrary-length label wraps to a second line the curve swells and swallows the first and last lines' text. Capping the width and clipping is what keeps the shape honest; the lower radius is what stops the text from crowding the corner. A chip standing for a **dismissible selection** (the group and member chips a `RecordPickerField` renders, and the single secret chip on `SecretRefField`) carries a trailing remove button: a `size-5` round `lucide` `X` target, borderless and `on-surface-variant` at rest, taking an `error/40` outline and an `error/10` wash on hover and the standard `focus-visible:ring-2` — in `error/50` here, since removing an assignment is the same destructive verb `DeleteIconButton` speaks. It is hand-rolled rather than reusing `DeleteIconButton`/`ActionIconButton`, whose `size-8` and own `glass-panel` would stack a second glass tier inside a `text-xs` pill, and it stops at `pointer-coarse:size-7` rather than the usual ~44px touch target, which inside this pill would triple the chip's height. A chip standing for a **selectable option** (the tag grid in `TagPickerDialog`) instead makes the *whole* pill the control: the same shape on a `<button aria-pressed>` root, with the standard `focus-visible:ring-2 ring-accent/50` and a `motion-safe:active:scale-[0.97]` press. The two are mutually exclusive — a remove button cannot nest inside a button — and a pressed chip is marked twice over, by `.tag-chip-selected`'s stronger fill and by a leading 14px `Check`, because in a grid where every chip is already colored, a fill change alone is not a state anyone can read. A **row of chips inside a table cell** (`ChipRow` — the `Tags` column) wraps to at most two lines of `Chip`'s compact `xs` size: it shows as many chips as those two lines hold at the column's actual width and folds the rest into one neutral `+N` chip. That chip is a `<button>`: clicking it opens a modal `Dialog` (`size="md"`, `scrollable`) that lays out **every** chip in the row — not just the folded ones — as a wrapping grid, each carrying its own description-on-hover tooltip, which a hover panel could never host. The whole set rather than the leftovers, so the reader never has to merge what the dialog shows with what is still on the row. Left to wrap *freely*, a chip row would make row height a function of the data — a record with eight tags standing three lines tall beside a record with one — and hand the column its full max-content width at every other column's expense. Capping the wrap at two lines and dropping the chip to the `xs` size (11px mono, no vertical padding) holds every row at the height one `sm` line plus the cell padding kept before; the `Tags` column trims that padding (`py-1!`) and keeps its cells vertically centred so a lightly tagged row's one line sits mid-row like the text columns. The fit is measured from the rendered chips and redone whenever the column resizes, so narrowing the column raises `N` rather than widening the table. Only chips that fit *whole* are shown — a pill clipped mid-label names its tag no better than the count does, and letting it spill would push the count, the one mark saying there is more to see, out of the cell — so a column too narrow for even one whole chip on the first line shows the count alone. The folded chips are unmounted, so their labels are also handed to assistive technology in an `sr-only` span listing only those — a screen-reader user hears them without opening the dialog.
- **Active sidebar item indicator:** A 3px accent vertical bar on the left edge, with a soft glow.

## Accessibility

- **Focus ring** — Every interactive element (buttons, inputs, textareas, selects, custom clickable elements) uses `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-accent/50` as its keyboard-focus treatment. This is already consistent across ~15 components (`components/ui/button.tsx`, `ThemeToggle.tsx`, `NotificationBell.tsx`, `UserMenu.tsx`, etc.) — reuse it rather than inventing a one-off focus style for a new component.
- **ARIA attributes** — Interactive or dynamically-updating elements carry appropriate `aria-label`, `aria-live`, and `role` (e.g. `role="menu"` for dropdowns) attributes. Purely decorative icons stay `aria-hidden` (see Iconography); an icon that carries standalone meaning gets a label instead.

## Components

- **Buttons:**
  - *Primary:* Gradient fill `from-accent to-secondary`, white text, inner-top highlight + soft accent shadow. Lifts 2px on hover with an accent glow.
  - *Secondary:* `glass-panel` background, on-surface text, accent text + glow on hover; lifts 2px (motion-safe).
  - *Ghost:* Transparent, on-surface-variant text, mild glass tint on hover; lifts 2px (motion-safe).
  - *Submitting state:* Buttons that send a server request (Save, Sign in, Approve/Reject, Load more) pass a `status` to the shared `Button` and cycle their label through three stages — idle → `pendingLabel` → `doneLabel` (e.g. `Save → Saving… → Saved!`), reverting to idle ~2s after success. All three labels are stacked in one grid cell so the button **reserves the widest label's width and never reflows** — the same "reserve layout to avoid a swap-time jump" intent as the **Skeleton**. The hidden sizer copies are `aria-hidden` so the button keeps its visible label as its accessible name. State is driven by the `useAsyncAction` hook (see Motion → Patterns).
  - *Success (`done`) state:* While "Saved!" shows, the button turns **solid success-green** (`--color-success`, overriding the variant's fill/gradient) with a leading **checkmark** icon and a matching green glow, and plays a one-shot celebratory **wiggle** (`motion-safe`). It is held **non-interactive** (rendered `disabled`, but kept at full opacity) for the whole ~2s so a completed save cannot be re-triggered. `pending` is likewise non-interactive but keeps the standard dimmed `disabled` look. Reduced-motion keeps the green + checkmark but drops the shake. The `done` stage is **skipped** (`useAsyncAction({ showDone: false })`, and no `doneLabel`) whenever success takes the button off screen — a control that unmounts on completion (`AvatarField`'s Remove), or one whose success closes the surface it sits on (`AvatarDialog`'s Save and Upload, which hand the eye back to the avatar in the hero behind them). Celebrating on a button that is already sliding away reads as a stutter, not as feedback; the `pending` label still appears for a slow request either way.
- **Inputs / Textareas / Selects:** `glass-panel` background with accent ring on focus (`ring-accent/50`). 12px radius. Placeholder text uses `placeholder:text-on-surface-variant/50` — not the bare `on-surface-variant` token — so it stays visibly lighter than filled-in values (`text-on-surface`) instead of reading as near-identical secondary text. `Select`'s option list is not a native OS dropdown — it's a portaled `glass-panel-overlay` listbox, matching the frosted look of the trigger instead of breaking out to an unstyled system menu.
- **Read-only values (`DetailList` / `DetailItem`):** The only label/value treatment for read-only detail screens (a workflow execution, an approval, `/profile`, and every admin detail page's `AuditMeta` aside) — never hand-write a `dt`/`dd` pair. The label keeps `text-label-caps`, identical to `FormField`'s label; the value sits on a **recessed field surface** below it: `outline-variant` border, `surface-dim/40` fill, `rounded-xl`, and a shallow inset shadow (`--inner-track-shadow`), with a `min-h-9` floor so a mono commit SHA and an em-dash placeholder hold the same height. Without a surface of its own the value loses to its own label — the caps label is the heavier mark, so a stack of bare pairs reads as one undifferentiated column of text and the eye cannot find where a pair ends. Giving the value a field restores `FormField`'s label/input rhythm, so a read-only page and an editable one share a skeleton (and the `FormSkeleton` placeholder, already a stack of `rounded-xl` bars, now matches what replaces it). The surface is **recessed, not raised glass**, for the same reason `SegmentedControl`'s track is: inverting the raised tiers is what stops it from being read as an editable input. The one attribute type that may leave the list is a **boolean account flag** (`enabled`, `emailVerified` on `/profile`): rendered as a `StatusPill` instead — a tinted `rounded-full` pill in `success` or `alert` carrying a `Check`/`TriangleAlert` glyph and naming the state it is actually in (`Enabled` / `Disabled`, `Email verified` / `Email not verified`). A label/value row spends a caps label and a full field on the word "Yes", which buries exactly the thing the reader is scanning for; the pill states it twice over, in tint and in glyph, so it survives grayscale and a glance. This is a promotion, not a duplication — a flag shown as a pill does not also appear in the list.
- **SectionCard:** The named container for a page section: `flex flex-col gap-5 rounded-2xl glass-panel-strong p-6` with a heading row of an accent icon tile (`h-9 w-9 rounded-xl glass-panel-strong text-accent shadow-glow`, `spin-occasional`) and an `h2`. It reuses `AdminPageHeader`'s tile so a section heading reads as a quieter echo of the page heading above it rather than as a new shape. Reach for it whenever a page would otherwise stack several bare cards separated only by rules — a long read-only list splits far better into two named sections (`/profile`'s **Account** and **Access**) than into one undifferentiated column, because the headings tell the eye where one subject ends. It is also the shared home for the card class string the admin form pages currently hand-write; new cards should use the component rather than copy that string again.
- **ProfileHero:** `/profile`'s identity card, and the page's `h1`. A `h-28` banner of the sanctioned `from-accent to-secondary` gradient fading out to the right sits across the card's top with a `glass-border` lower edge, and the avatar — 120px inside a `rounded-full glass-panel-strong p-1` frame — straddles that edge. The heading is the **user's own name** (falling back to the username), with `Profile` demoted to a `text-label-caps` eyebrow above it: the same rule detail pages follow in naming the record rather than the operation, and the largest type on the page should not be spent on a word every visitor already knows. Below it sit the `@handle` in the mono data face, the direct-role `Badge`s, and the account `StatusPill`s. **The avatar is the editor's only trigger** — a real `button` labelled "Edit avatar" that opens `AvatarDialog`, carrying a standing `Camera` badge on its lower-right edge and darkening under a full `Camera` scrim on hover and on keyboard focus. The badge, not the scrim, is what makes the avatar legible as editable on a touchscreen: this is the one hover-revealed control that must **not** fall back to `pointer-coarse:`, because Chrome reports a coarse pointer on hybrid touchscreen laptops and would pin a full-cover scrim open for mouse users, hiding the very thing it offers to edit. Making the avatar itself the control is what lets the page carry no editing chrome at all: the one editable thing is the one thing you can click.
- **SegmentedControl:** A `rounded-full` **recessed track** — `outline-variant` border, `surface-dim/40` fill, and an inset shadow (`--inner-track-shadow`) — deliberately the inverse of the raised glass tiers. Inputs and selects share the `glass-panel` surface, so a raised pill sitting among form fields reads as a filled-in text field; the well is what tells the eye "this is a switch, and something slides inside it." The selected option is an accent pill that **springs** between segments (see Motion → Patterns) rather than cutting, and unselected segments wash to `accent-soft` on hover so they read as pressable rather than as static label text. An option may carry a leading `lucide` icon when the icon genuinely distinguishes the choices (Globe vs Terminal for an MCP server's transport) — never as decoration on every segment. Implemented as a `tablist` with roving `tabindex`: arrow keys, Home, and End move both the selection and the focus, and only the selected segment is a tab stop.
- **Data Tables:** Wrapped in a 16px-radius `glass-panel`, `border-collapse`. Header uses a stronger glass tint (`glass-strong/70`) with a `divider` underline so it reads clearly apart from the body. Columns and rows are separated by `divider` grid lines — a dedicated token tinted dark in light mode and light in dark mode so it stays visible where the near-white `glass-border` would vanish (full strength in the header, `/60` in the body). Body rows are zebra-striped via the `even:` variant (`glass-strong/15`); hover overrides with an `accent-soft` wash. A row can also be **called out from elsewhere on the page** (`highlightedRowKey`): when a cell names another row — hovering a dependency chip in "Depends on" — that row takes an inset `ring-accent/50` plus a forced `accent-soft` fill (forced because the zebra stripe is a `:nth-child` rule and outranks a plain background utility). Every row carries its key as `data-row-key`, which is how such a reference finds its target. A list that uses this shows **all** its records rather than paginating — a callout is worthless if the row it points at is on another page. Each header cell carries a draggable resize strip on its right edge that tints `accent` on hover. A sortable/filterable column renders its whole header as a single full-width menu trigger (`TableHeaderMenu`) that opens a portaled glass dropdown (`glass-panel-overlay`, styled like the account menu's items) with labeled "Sort ascending" / "Sort descending" toggle actions and, below a divider, the column filter — a debounced text input or a select. The trigger carries its persistent state in a **single 16px indicator slot**, and that slot is absolutely positioned in the header cell's own right padding rather than laid out beside the label — so a sortable/filterable column is no wider than a plain one, and applying a filter cannot shift the label. It shows an accent `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` for the active sort direction, an accent `Funnel` when only a filter is applied, and a low-opacity `ChevronDown` when idle that strengthens on hover to signal the menu; a small accent dot rides along on whichever glyph is showing whenever a filter is applied, which is how a column that is both sorted and filtered says so with one glyph. Parking the slot outside the flow is deliberate: two inline icons plus their gaps used to add ~48px to every menu column's minimum width, which is dead space on a narrow column (`Enabled`, `Role`, `Tags`) whose header is short and whose cells are narrower still. It stays a child of the trigger button, so clicking the icon still opens the menu — and it stops short of the cell's resize strip, which sits above it and would otherwise take those clicks and show a `col-resize` cursor over the icon. By default every text cell clips to one line with an overflow tooltip; columns rendering interactive or multi-line content opt out. Column widths are measured from the natural layout once the rows arrive and then **fitted to the panel**, so the whole table — including the trailing actions column — always stays on screen. The fit is capped, not proportional: the text columns share a width ceiling that is lowered until they fit, so a column with width to burn (a long prompt, a repo URL) absorbs the shortfall while an already-narrow column is left alone rather than being squeezed until its own header clips. Action columns, which have no ellipsis to fall back on, keep their natural width — which is why a chip caps its own label width (see Shapes) rather than letting one long title claim the column. A column whose cell clips *itself* says so with `shrinkable` and rejoins the flexible set: a `ChipRow`'s `+N` fold is an ellipsis by another name, so the `Tags` column gives ground like a text column instead of squeezing every other one. Because such a cell measures *as it currently renders*, a natural width is measured once per column and cached for as long as the table lives: re-measuring a folded chip row on a column-set change would read back the width the last fit imposed, fold further, and measure narrower still, until the column sat on its header. Nothing drops below its own header content width (measured from a hidden nowrap sizer; 60px is the absolute fallback floor) — so header labels are never ellipsized, whether by the auto-fit or by drag-resizing. The fit is redone whenever the panel resizes. The panel scrolls horizontally only when the columns genuinely cannot fit, or after the user widens one by dragging — content is never clipped out of reach. While loading, the body shows shimmering **skeleton** rows that mirror the column layout (no spinner) so the table never reflows on data arrival.
- **Column picker:** Which columns a list table shows is the viewer's to choose, through a `Columns3` `HeaderIconButton` in the page header's action cluster (immediately after Refresh, sharing the round glass chrome so the two read as one toolbar). It opens the same portaled `glass-panel-overlay` dropdown the column header menu uses — right-aligned to its trigger since the trigger sits near the viewport's right edge, `snappy` transition — holding a `CheckboxGroup` (passed `flush`, so the group's own glass panel doesn't stack a second tier inside the overlay) under a `"COLUMNS"` section label, then a divider and a "Reset to default" item. Toggling a column deliberately leaves the panel open. The section-label row also carries a **"Show all" / "Hide all"** bulk toggle, styled as a small label-cased text button rather than a full-width menu row so it reads as an action on all the columns rather than as one more column. **The panel is fitted to the viewport by `useAnchoredPanel`** (see Responsive & touch → Popovers): it flips above the trigger when the space below runs out, caps its height at what that side offers, and holds the label row and the reset action at its edges while only the checkbox list scrolls — a table with seventeen columns would otherwise hang its lower half off the bottom of a laptop screen, with the reset action unreachable. Past eight options the panel widens from 220px to 420px and the group switches to a **two-column grid**, halving how far that list scrolls; on a viewport too narrow to grant that width it folds back to one column on its own. Identifier and action columns are declared `visibility: "always"` and never appear in the list; a column too niche for the default view is declared `"optional"` and starts unchecked, which is how a table keeps its width for what matters. The choice persists per table in `localStorage`.
- **Assignment pickers:** A field that assigns records from an open-ended set never renders them inline — neither as a checkbox list nor as a `Select` that downloads the whole set. It shows the current selection as a row of removable **chips** (an em-dash `ReadOnlyField` when empty) under a `text-label-caps` span, with a secondary "Select …" button below it opening `RecordPickerDialog`: the same `DataTable` + `useTableQuery` + `PaginationControls` trio the admin list pages use, so paging, per-column sort, and per-column filters are all server-side and the dialog behaves exactly like the list page for that resource. The draft lives in dialog state, so a record picked on the first page stays picked after the operator has paged past it; **Cancel** discards it and **Select** confirms. The dialog is mounted on first open and then kept mounted, so it costs no request until asked for. Its first column is a `Checkbox` when several records may be chosen and a `Radio` when only one may (`multiple={false}`) — a real radio group, so the browser enforces the "at most one" rule rather than leaving a set of checkboxes to mysteriously clear each other. The footer summarizes a multi-select as a count (`3 selected`) but a single-select **by name**, since "1 selected" tells an operator nothing they cannot already see; the name is read from the labels of every row seen so far, because the chosen row may have been paged away. The label field is deliberately a plain span rather than a `FormField`, whose `<label htmlFor>` would otherwise become the accessible name of the trigger button. A small, curated vocabulary is the exception: `TagPickerDialog` keeps the same outer contract but lays its options out as a wrapping grid of toggle chips filtered client-side, because the whole set is already in hand.
- **Skeleton:** Shimmering placeholder surface (`@utility skeleton`: a tinted `--skeleton-base` block with a brighter `--skeleton-sheen` band swept across by `--animate-shimmer`). Both tokens are theme-tuned so the shimmer reads clearly against light and dark glass panels. Used to reserve layout during data fetches — list rows, a detail page's form fields and its record-name title, and the workflow chat view — so content swaps in without jump or blank flash. Reduced-motion collapses it to a static block.
- **Status Badges:** Pill-shaped, gradient or glass per state.
- **Chat bubbles:** A session chat is one conversation several people and the agent post into (workflow executions, design sessions), so the thread reads on two axes at once: **which side** a bubble takes says whether it is *yours*, and **what surface** it wears says whether a human or the agent produced it. The viewer's own messages sit on the right with their avatar on the right edge; everyone else's — the agent's and the other participants' alike — sit on the left with theirs on the left edge. On that crowded left side the fill is what separates them: **humans are tinted, the agent is colorless glass.** The single-user chat (`/sessions/[sessionId]`) has one possible sender and renders no avatars, so it keeps the plain right-aligned layout throughout.
  - *User (own):* Accent gradient fill, asymmetric corner (`rounded-tr-md`, or `rounded-br-md` when an avatar sits beside it), inner-top highlight.
  - *User (another participant):* Left-aligned, `bg-secondary/12` over a `border-secondary/25` hairline, `rounded-bl-md` — the pale form of your own bubble's gradient, so a human's message stays recognizable as one without competing with your own. Keeps the user bubble's `max-w-[75%]` rather than the assistant's full width.
  - *Assistant:* `glass-panel`, asymmetric corner (`rounded-tl-md`), accent-colored streaming caret. Content is rendered as **Markdown** (see Markdown content below). While streaming, the bubble carries the signature **live edge** (see Motion → Patterns).
  - *Reasoning ("thinking"):* `ReasoningBubble` — a dashed-border, italic panel (`bg-glass`, asymmetric `rounded-tl-md` corner like the assistant bubble) labelled with a 💭 "Thinking" header, rendering the agent's streamed reasoning text below the reply's normal weight and color. Renders nothing until reasoning text arrives. While the agent is still reasoning and hasn't started a reply yet, it carries the signature **live edge** in place of the generic "Agent is thinking…" pulse.
- **Markdown content:** Agent-generated Markdown (assistant chat bubbles and the A2UI `Text` component) is rendered to HTML by `marked` and styled by the `markdown-body` utility (globals.css) — the single source of truth restoring what Tailwind preflight strips: heading scale (display face for h1/h2, tight tracking), list bullets, mono `code`/`pre` blocks on a `surface-container-high` tint with `overflow-x` scrolling, accent-colored links, `divider` rules, and outline-bordered tables, all sized to the 14px body scale.
- **A2UI surfaces:** An interactive surface in a session chat — an A2UI form, an `ApprovalControls` panel — follows the same side rule as the bubbles above once somebody has acted on it: answered by the viewer it moves to the right with their avatar on the right edge, answered by anyone else it stays left with theirs on the left. Until then nobody is attributed, no avatar shows, and it sits left as the agent's own output. `customCard` is rendered as `glass-panel-strong`. `customChoicePicker` chips use the same primary-gradient when selected and `glass-panel` when not, and scale up slightly (~1.03) on hover (motion-safe); a single-choice picker with five or more options drops the radio list and renders the shared `Select` instead, so its glass-panel trigger and portaled listbox are the ones documented under the form controls above. `customButton` always renders white text regardless of its `primary`/`secondary`/`ghost` variant: a descendant selector (`[&_*]:!text-white`) forces white onto whatever `buildChild` renders inside (typically a nested `Text`, which otherwise keeps its own darker variant-based color class internally, overriding the shared `Button`'s per-variant text color).
- **Theme Toggle:** A 36×36 round glass button in the chat header / admin sidebar bottom. Sun/Moon SVG icons; scales up slightly (~1.05) and emits accent glow on hover. Icons cross-fade with a 90° rotation on toggle.
- **EmptyState:** Centered placeholder for empty regions (no messages, no rows, no sessions). Pairs an `AnimatedIcon` inside a frosted-glass tile with an optional title and description. Has a `compact` variant for tight containers (session sidebar, table empty cell). See `@/components/ui/empty-state.tsx`.
- **Route loading/error boundaries:** Every route segment has a `loading.tsx` built from the same shared skeleton the page's own post-mount loading state uses (`FormSkeleton`, `AdminListSkeleton`, `WorkflowSessionSkeleton`, `ChatPanelSkeleton`) so the Suspense fallback and the page's own loading state are visually identical. Shells with persistent chrome (root, `(admin)`, `(chat)`, `/profile`) each have an `error.tsx` built on `RouteErrorFallback` (`EmptyState` + `Button reset`) so a render crash doesn't unmount the section's sidebar/header; `global-error.tsx` is the last-resort fallback for a crash in the root layout itself. A single root `not-found.tsx` handles unmatched URLs.

### Iconography

Icons come from [`lucide-react`](https://lucide.dev) (stroke icons, `strokeWidth={1.8}` to match the app's hand-drawn glyphs, `currentColor` for theme tinting). Wrap any icon that should animate in `AnimatedIcon` (`@/components/ui/animated-icon.tsx`), which applies a `motion-safe`-gated looping animation (`bob`, `breathe`, `spin-slow`, `spin-occasional`, `wiggle`, or `none`). Decorative icons are `aria-hidden` by default — add a label when an icon carries standalone meaning. Admin page headers pass an `icon` to `AdminPageHeader` (and lists pass the matching `emptyIcon` to `DataTable`) so each section reads at a glance; both twirl occasionally (`spin-occasional`) rather than bobbing. A detail page keeps its section's icon next to the record name, which is what ties the page back to the list it came from once the title no longer names the section.

## Motion

Motion follows a **Material You — "emphasized, gentle"** model: short durations, an emphasized easing curve for entrances, and React Spring physics for anything that mounts or unmounts. The intent is responsive without being chatty — every user action gets a small acknowledgement, never a long ceremony.

### Tokens (exposed as Tailwind v4 vars on `:root`)

| Token | Value | Use |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `--motion-duration-fast` | 150ms | Micro-interactions (icon hover, ✕ reveal) |
| `--motion-duration-base` | 240ms | Default for state transitions, button hovers |
| `--motion-duration-slow` | 360ms | Larger surface changes (modals, banners) |
| `--motion-ease-standard` | `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` | Default ease-out for transitions |
| `--motion-ease-emphasized` | `cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0, 1)` | Entrance choreography (message bubbles, lists) |
| `--motion-ease-exit` | `cubic-bezier(0.3, 0, 0.8, 0.15)` | Exit / dismiss animations |

### Spring presets (`@/lib/motion.ts`)

| Preset | Config | Use |
|--------|--------|-----|
| `gentle` | `{ tension: 220, friction: 28 }` | Default for entrance/exit, dialogs, list items |
| `snappy` | `{ tension: 320, friction: 26 }` | Brief feedback — theme toggle, send-button glow |
| `bouncy` | `{ tension: 260, friction: 18 }` | Reserved for playful confirmations |

Choose presets by intent (`useMotionConfig("gentle")`) rather than tuning tension/friction at call sites.

### Patterns

- **Entrance** — Message bubbles, error banners use the `animate-message-in` keyframe (`opacity 0→1` + `translateY(8px)→0` + slight `scale(0.985)→1`).
- **List staggering** — Session list rows use React Spring `useTransition` with `trail: 40` to ripple in horizontally on first load.
- **Modal** — `ConfirmDialog` cross-fades the backdrop and `scale(0.94)→1` the body with a gentle spring. The scrim carries only a trace `backdrop-blur-[2px]` — the frosted look comes from the panel's own `glass-panel-overlay` blur, so the scrim stays light enough that the page behind the dialog is still legible and colorful content remains available for the panel to refract.
- **Buttons** — All variants share `active:scale-[0.97]` for tactile press feedback and lift 2px on hover (`motion-safe`-guarded). Server-submitting buttons additionally use **optimistic UI** via `useAsyncAction`: the button disables immediately on click (preventing double-submits), and the `pending` label ("Saving…") only appears if the response takes longer than 200ms — fast responses skip straight to the `done` label, so quick saves never flash a transient "Saving…". On success the button stays non-interactive and celebrates with a green fill, checkmark, and one-shot `wiggle` (see Components → Buttons → Success state). The label width is fixed (see Components → Buttons) so none of these transitions reflow the button.
- **Sliding selection indicator** — The admin sidebar's and session list's 3px active bar and `SegmentedControl`'s selection pill are one mechanism: `useSlidingIndicator` (`@/hooks/useSlidingIndicator`) measures the active item with `getBoundingClientRect`, springs `offset` and `size` along a single axis (`vertical` for the bars, `horizontal` for the pill), re-measures under a `ResizeObserver`, and applies the first position `immediate` so nothing animates in on mount. Any new "highlight that follows the selection" reuses the hook — never re-implement the measurement.
- **Live edge (signature)** — While an agent is streaming (assistant bubble), a tool is running (`ToolActivityBubble`'s pill), the agent is still reasoning with no reply text yet (`ReasoningBubble`'s panel), or the agent is working with nothing else on screen yet (`WorkingIndicator`'s "Agent is thinking…" pill), the `live-edge` utility sends a comet of accent light around the panel's border: a conic gradient whose `from` angle (`@property --live-angle`) rotates via the `live-sweep` keyframes (2.4s linear), masked down to a thin ring on an overlay pseudo-element. Outside the chat it marks the same thing on the admin side: the workflow detail page's status bar (`app/(admin)/workflows/[workflowId]/page.tsx`) carries it while `publish` runs the description summarizer and while the workflow is still `generating`, the same page's Generated description field carries it while `generateDescription` re-summarizes the design conversation, the Generate Workflow dialog panel carries it while the design run is being handed off, and the design session's `DescriptionDiffDialog` (`app/workflows/[workflowId]/design-session/page.tsx`) carries it — showing a placeholder skeleton in place of the diff — from the moment "Generate description" is triggered until the summary lands. The rule for adding a carrier is one thing only: **a generative-AI run is actually in flight behind that surface.** This is the one place the UI spends continuous motion and it means "the flow is live", so never apply it decoratively to idle surfaces (a workflow row that merely sits in an in-progress state keeps its calmer accent tint/glow instead). For a surface driven by `useAsyncAction`, gate it on `status === "pending"`, not `inFlight` — that reuses the 200ms optimistic-UI delay described under **Buttons** above, so a fast response or a fast rejection never flashes the light. The one exception is `DescriptionDiffDialog`'s `loading`: it gates on `inFlight` instead, because during that 200ms window the dialog's `generated`/`description` props are still last render's stale (often empty) values, so a `pending`-gated skeleton would let a misleading "no diff" message flash through before the skeleton ever appears. Reduced-motion swaps the sweep for a static translucent accent ring.
- **Streaming caret** — Assistant bubble caret uses both `animate-blink` (the original step-start blink, preserved for tests) and `motion-safe:animate-pulse-cursor` (a softer opacity + scaleY pulse) so motion-safe users get the richer effect.
- **Theme toggle** — Scales up slightly on hover (motion-safe); Sun/Moon icons cross-fade with a 90° rotation via `useTransition`.
- **Decorative icons** — Accent icons in empty states and page headers loop through small-amplitude keyframes, all `motion-safe`-gated: `bob` (gentle ±4px float, chat/sidebar empty states), `breathe` (subtle scale + opacity swell, chat empty state), `spin-slow` (9s continuous rotation), `spin-occasional` (a quick full turn around the Y/vertical axis — a coin-like flip with `perspective` depth — every ~8s on a long rest, used by admin header and admin empty-table icons), `wiggle` (one-shot ±10° shake), and `attention` (a brief wiggle on a long rest, used by the notification bell when there are unread items). Kept deliberately distinct from the large-amplitude background drifts (`float-slow`/`float-slower`).

### Reduced motion

`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` collapses every animation/transition to ~0ms in `globals.css`. React Spring code paths also call `useMotionConfig`, which detects the same preference and returns `{ duration: 0 }` so lifecycle callbacks still fire. Never assume animations will run — code defensively around their completion.
